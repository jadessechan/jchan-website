                    This <strong>feed forward neural network</strong> utilized several mainstream and open-source libraries
                    including <strong>Keras</strong>, <strong>TensorFlow</strong> and <strong>Pytorch</strong>. 
                    I used the PyTorch built-in methods to more efficiently
                    build and perform backpropagation for the neural network. In addition, I used the <strong>MNIST handwritten
                    numbers dataset</strong> to train the neural network on subsequent recognition. After training, the neural
                    network achieved an accuracy of 95%+ on other MNIST test data and various user input. This project
                    is part of sentdex's Deep Learning with Python series on YouTube.

                    I have always had a desire to code my own neural network of some kind, and was inspired through
                    several informative youtube series. Other than sentdex, 3Blue1Brown's Deep Learning series gave me
                    a more advanced insight on the inner mechanisms of a neural network and how to construct one on my
                    own. Although the construction of the complex neural network did not yield an entire understanding
                    of every internal mechanism, the process taught me countless valuable lessons in data processing.
                    For example, the processes of iterating over data, passing data to a model, calculating loss from
                    the result, and performing backpropagation to slowly fit the model to the data showed me basic
                    functionalities of data processing by machine learning. During the development of the neural
                    network, I was greatly surprised by the necessity of proper data organization and manipulation
                    in order to finalize the project.

                    My favorite part about coding this neural network was learning how to implement various
                    open-source libraries and utilizing the MNIST dataset. Coding this neural network exposed me to a
                    plethora of resources that helped demystify the complexity and intricacy of neural networks.
                    In the future, I hope to code another neural network that uses the Fashion MNIST dataset. Such a project
                    would be a stepping stone toward my goal of using AI to bridge the gap between fashion and technology.
