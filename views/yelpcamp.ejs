                    YelpCamp is the first <strong>full-stack dynamic web application</strong> that I coded. 
                    It allows users to add / update campgrounds, write comments, and leave custom reviews on a campsite. 
                    The framework of the project is based on a <strong>MEN (MongoDB, Express, Node) stack that utilizes REST routing structure</strong>. 
                    In addition to the implementation of my own custom CSS styling, I utilized the <strong>Bootstrap 4</strong> library to
                    organize objects in an adaptable and responsive manner. YelpCamp is the final project from a
                    Udemy-based Web Development Bootcamp course that I took during the Covid-19 self-quarantine period.

                    A fun challenge of this process was my use of the Webstorm IDE by JetBrains, a software I had never
                    previously experienced. Before my online course had taught me the use of routes and partials,
                    Webstorm encouraged a more professional web development environment, which included the use of these
                    routes and partials ideas. Not only was this specific instance difficult to adapt to, but every
                    professional feature that Webstorm offers, although ultimately beneficial, provides a new challenge.
                    In addition, this project helped refine my debugging process in a language that I was relatively new
                    to. For example, tracing the common JavaScript undefined object errors required a disciplined and
                    focused debugging approach that I had not previously done before. YelpCamp incorporates various
                    practices that a majority of professional and mainstream web applications employ. These include
                    important features such as authentication, authorization, and responsive design. Although difficult,
                    this project not only made me a better developer overall, it also inspired me to make beautifully
                    dynamic projects in the future.

                    Prior to coding YelpCamp, all of my exercises for the web dev bootcamp were on Atom.
                    My transition to WebStorm helped me understand how all the components of html, css, and javascript
                    come together in YelpCamp. Another one of my favorite parts about coding YelpCamp was using a database,
                    because I could reflect on how social media websites like Reddit use databases to store vast amounts
                    of information. The design process was also eye-opening for me because I tend to work from small to
                    large - perfecting each detail before moving onto the next. However, coding YelpCamp demonstrated
                    the advantages of working on the big picture before making UI improvements.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the future, I will apply this design process to future projects. I will start with a wireframe, then code the bare skeleton, and finally focus
                    on the UI improvements. This design process I learned - coupled with the same features I included in
                    YelpCamp: authorization and authentication, I hope to create a more efficient and beautiful website for
                    users to interact with.
