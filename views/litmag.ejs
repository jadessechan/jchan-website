                    Crow Magazine is part of my final project for my Spring 2020 Literary Magazine class. Students were tasked to
                    create a fictious magazine and design a mock print cover or website to advertise it. Naturally, I opted to design 
                    and develop a website. I created a static website using the <strong>Bootstrap 4</strong> library and implemented
                    the <strong>RESTful routes</strong>. This is the first website I coded on my own after completing the Web Developer
                    Bootcamp Course on Udemy.
